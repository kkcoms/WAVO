# Project Title: WAVO

## Team Members (if applicable):
- Jacob Barrera

## Project Description:
I am currently in the process of defining my capstone project, and I am considering the development of an application or web-based platform designed to bridge the generation gap by connecting individuals with elderly people. This initiative aims to harness the wealth of knowledge and wisdom that older generations possess while combating the issue of social isolation often experienced by seniors in care centers.

## Project Objectives:
- **Knowledge Sharing:** The primary goal of this project is to create a platform where older individuals can share their life experiences, knowledge, and wisdom with younger generations. This will facilitate intergenerational learning and foster meaningful connections.
- **Social Interaction:** By facilitating interactions between different age groups, the project intends to alleviate the social isolation that many elderly people face, ultimately improving their overall quality of life.
- **Ease of Use:** The application or web app will be user-friendly and accessible to both elderly individuals and younger users. It will provide a seamless experience for connecting and engaging in conversations.
- **Community Building:** The platform will encourage the formation of a supportive community where users can share stories, engage in discussions, and form lasting friendships.
- **Contribution to Aging Population:** As the global population continues to age, this project will contribute to addressing the needs of the elderly population by offering a tool that promotes mental and emotional well-being.

## Technologies Used:
I am currently in the process of defining the technologies for my project, but I am considering the following options:

### Front-end Technologies:
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
- React.js or Angular (for building the user interface)
- Bootstrap or Material-UI (for styling and layout)

### Back-end Technologies:
- Node.js or Python (for server-side scripting)
- Express.js or Django (as web frameworks)
- Database Management System (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
